# ASCII RPG Tutorial - Learn C and Game Development

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial series where you'll learn C programming and game development by building a complete ASCII RPG from scratch!

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial series teaches:
- C programming fundamentals (with a proper foundation in pointers and memory)
- Game development concepts
- The Raylib graphics library
- Software architecture and design
- Problem-solving and debugging skills

## Tutorial Structure

The tutorial is divided into carefully paced lessons, each building upon the previous:

### Foundation (Lessons 0-3)
0. **Setting Up Your Development Environment** - Installing tools and compilers
1. **Introduction** - Understanding ASCII games and why they're perfect for learning
2. **C Basics Part 1** - Variables, control flow, and simple programs
3. **C Basics Part 2** - Arrays, functions, and structures

### C Programming Deep Dive (Lessons 4-6)
4. **Understanding Pointers and Memory** - The key to C programming
5. **Functions, Headers, and Program Structure** - Organizing larger programs
6. **Building Your First Text Game** - Practice project before graphics

### Graphics and Game Basics (Lessons 7-10)
7. **Getting Started with Raylib** - Creating your first graphical window
8. **ASCII Characters and Rendering** - Building a text-based rendering system
9. **Player Movement and Input** - Making your game interactive
10. **Checkpoint Project: Simple ASCII Explorer** - Consolidate your learning

### Core Game Systems (Lessons 11-15)
11. **Creating Game Worlds Part 1** - Basic maps and levels
12. **Creating Game Worlds Part 2** - Camera systems and larger worlds
13. **Collision Detection** - Making the world solid
14. **Basic Enemies and AI** - Adding simple challenges
15. **Checkpoint Project: Dungeon Crawler** - A playable mini-game

### Advanced Systems (Lessons 16-20)
16. **Combat System** - Creating engaging battles
17. **Inventory and Items** - Managing game objects
18. **NPCs and Dialogue** - Adding character interactions
19. **Shops and Economy** - Creating game systems
20. **Checkpoint Project: Mini RPG** - Complete game with all systems

### Polish and Completion (Lessons 21-23)
21. **Quests and Progression** - Adding game goals
22. **Game States, Menus, and Saving** - Creating a complete experience
23. **The Complete Game** - Final project with polish and features

## Practice Exercises

Each lesson includes:
- 3-5 practice exercises with solutions
- "Try This" modifications to experiment with
- Common mistakes and how to fix them

## Prerequisites

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Basic typing skills
- Enthusiasm to learn!

No prior programming experience is required. We'll start from the very beginning.

## The Game We're Building

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created:
- A playable ASCII RPG with a hero character (@)
- Multiple levels with walls (#) and doors (+)
- Enemies (g for goblins, o for orcs) with AI
- Combat system with health and damage
- Items to collect (! for potions, / for swords)
- Inventory system
- NPCs to talk to and shops to buy from
- Quests to complete
- Save/load functionality
- Main menu and game over screens

## Learning Philosophy

This tutorial emphasizes:
- **Gradual progression**: Each concept is introduced slowly with lots of practice
- **Learning by doing**: Every lesson includes hands-on coding
- **Understanding over memorization**: We explain WHY, not just HOW
- **Small steps**: No lesson introduces too many new concepts at once
- **Checkpoint projects**: Regular opportunities to consolidate learning

## How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Go in order**: Each lesson builds on previous ones
2. **Type the code**: Don't copy-paste - typing helps learning
3. **Do the exercises**: Practice is essential
4. **Experiment**: Try changing things and see what happens
5. **Take breaks**: Learning programming takes time

Let's create something amazing together!
